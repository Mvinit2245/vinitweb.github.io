	<h3><mark>In this we will learn about the Statue of Unity</mark></h3>
	<marquee  style=" background-color: orangered;"><b style="font-size: 26;"> Biggest Statue in the World </b> </marquee>
	<p> “India has got a rich cultural heritage of <b>“Unity in Diversity”</b>, the roots of which are inextricably founded on the principle of <strong>“Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam”</strong>, meaning that the entire universe is a family.

   At the time of <i>India’s independence in 1947</i>, it was however divided into more than 560 princely states and it was <em>India’s first Deputy Prime Minister</em>, Bharat Ratna Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who with his firm determination, could transform such imperialism into today’s unified India. People of India will remain indebted to him forever for his <u>leadership during the freedom struggle and his vision</u>, wisdom and statesmanship in the post-independence era. His life is an eternal source of inspiration for the present as well as future generations and it is in this context that his iconic monumental statue – <ins>the world’s tallest Statue of Unity</ins> has been dedicated to the Nation on the <sup>143rd</sup> Birth Anniversary.

   Symbolizing the <b>national, spiritual, historical and academic values</b>, the Statue of Unity will lead to the icon-based development of this entire region, which is predominantly a tribal area. Our vision is to make this place a world class tourist destination by providing infrastructure for edutainment, research, cultural, environmental enrichment and health promotion. A true leader keeps on enlightening the path of mankind even in his physical absence and the Statue of Unity is the realization of this – worth experiencing.”</p>
